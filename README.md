## Description
**ResourceNation** is my CS50 final project, designed as a **digital library** of previous year question papers for all the universities in my city. It aims to make past exam papers easily accessible to students across different universities and disciplines, providing a centralized platform for exam preparation.

### Key Features
- **User Authentication**: Users can **register** and **log in** to access the platform.
- **Course Directory**: After logging in, users are greeted with a course directory organized by the **typical courses** offered at universities. The directory is categorized by branches, such as **Engineering**, **Commerce**, **Arts**, etc.
- **Course-specific Question Papers**: Upon selecting a course from the directory, users are redirected to a page containing the collection of **previous year question papers** for that specific course.
- **User-friendly Interface**: The platform is built with simplicity in mind, making it easy for students to navigate and find the materials they need for their studies.

### Future Enhancements
- **Search Functionality**: Adding the ability for users to search for specific question papers by **year**, **course**, or **subject**.
- **Upload Feature**: Allowing users and university authorities to upload new question papers, making the library grow dynamically.
- **University Filter**: Adding a filter to view question papers from a particular university.
- **Study Resources**: Expanding the platform to include additional study materials, such as **syllabus documents**, **lecture notes**, and **sample answers**.

**ResourceNation** serves as a one-stop solution for students to access essential study resources, helping them in their academic journey by offering convenient access to past exams.
